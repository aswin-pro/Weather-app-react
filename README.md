## Weather App
This is a simple Weather App built using React that fetches current weather data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app dynamically updates the background image based on the current weather condition.

## Features
- City-based Weather Search: Enter a city name to get the current weather conditions, including weather type, temperature, and a description.
- Dynamic Background: The background image of the weather report changes based on the weather condition (e.g., rain, clear, clouds).
- Error Handling: If an invalid city name is entered, an error message will be displayed below the input box.
- Country Code Display: The app displays the country code corresponding to the entered city.
  
## Technologies Used
- React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data used in the application.

## Usage
- Enter the name of the city in the input box.

- The weather information, including the weather type, temperature, and description, will be displayed.
- The country code will be displayed along with the weather data.
